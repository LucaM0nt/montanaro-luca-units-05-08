# Seconds Calculator ‚è≥

This exercise demonstrates how to calculate the number of seconds that have passed today and the number of seconds remaining until tomorrow using the `Date` object in JavaScript.

## Assignment üìù

> Write two functions that based on the current date and time output the number of seconds:
> - getSecondsToday() returns the number of seconds from the beginning of today
> - getSecondsToTomorrow() returns the number of seconds till tomorrow


## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

1. Open the local [`index.html`](index.html) file in a web browser.
2. The script in `script.js` will run automatically and log the main outputs to the console.

## Functions üìã

### `getSecondsToday`

- **Description**: Calculates the number of seconds that have passed since the start of the current day.
- **Returns**: A string indicating the number of seconds that have passed today.

  ```

### `getSecondsToTomorrow`

- **Description**: Calculates the number of seconds remaining until the start of the next day.
- **Returns**: A string indicating the number of seconds left until tomorrow.

## Variables Table üìä

| `today`             | A `Date` object representing the start of the current day (midnight).      |
| `tomorrow`          | A `Date` object representing the start of the next day (midnight).         |
| `secondsToday`      | The number of seconds that have passed since the start of the current day. |
| `secondsToTomorrow` | The number of seconds remaining until the start of the next day.           |

## Example Output üì§
