# Recipe Exercise 🍳

This exercise demonstrates how to create and log information about recipes using JavaScript. The script uses objects to represent recipes and logs their details to the console.

## Assignment 📝

> - Create an object to hold information on your favorite recipe. It should have properties for title (a string), servings (a number), and ingredients (an array of strings)
> - On separate lines (one console.log statement for each), log the recipe information
> - **Bonus**: Create an array that holds several recipes and log them all.

## Usage 🛠️

1. Open the local `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The script in `script.js` will run automatically and log the main outputs to the console.

## Functionality 📋

### File: `script.js`

**Purpose**: Logs details about recipes to the console.

**Key Features**:
1. **Recipe Object**:
   - Each recipe is represented as an object with the following properties:
     - `title`: The title of the recipe.
     - `servings`: The number of servings.
     - `ingredients`: An array of ingredients.

2. **Logging Recipe Details**:
   - The script logs the details of each recipe to the console using separate `console.log` statements for each property.

3. **Bonus Feature**:
   - The script includes an array of multiple recipes and logs the details of all recipes in the array.
